# Description
For our week two project we were tasked with creating a food truck app  that uses a scanner to gather user input related to each truck. The user will open the app and be greeted with a welcome menu where they will be given a brief description of the app as well as the option to continue or exit the app. If the user says the would like to continue they will be prompted to enter the name, type of food, and rate each food truck they dined at. The user will be instructed they can only enter up to five  and they can enter the word quit if they ate at less than 5 trucks. When the user enters the word quit they will be brought to the main menu where they will be given a menu containing 4 options. If the user enter option 1 they will be given a list of all the trucks they entered as well as their rating and food type. If the user enters a 2 they will be shown the average rating of all of the trucks that they ate at. If the user enters a 3 then they will be shown the food truck that they rated the highest. Finally if the user enters a 4 they will call a method that terminates the program.

# Technologies Used
Eclipse, Terminal, Java, Atom, Github, Object  Oriented programming, Unicode Data, Encapsulation,  Arrays, While loops, for loops, if else statements, switch statements, getters and setters.

# What I learned
I learned how to use object oriented programming to create an array of food trucks and store information about each truck as well as assign each truck a unique ID. I also learned how to code unicode data into strings.
